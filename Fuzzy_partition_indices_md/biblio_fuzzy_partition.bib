	abstract = {One crucial tool in machine learning is a measure of partition similarity. This study focuses on the “probabilistic Rand index,” a variant of the Rand index. We look at this measure from diﬀerent perspectives: Probabilistic, information theoretic, and diversity-theoretic. These give some insight, reveal relationships with other types of measures, and suggest some possible alternative interpretations.},

	abstract = {There is a family of well-known external clustering validity indexes to measure the degree of compatibility or similarity between two hard partitions of a given data set, including partitions with different numbers of categories. A uniﬁed, fully equivalent set-theoretic formulation for an important class of such indexes was derived and extended to the fuzzy domain in a previous work by the author [Campello, R.J.G.B., 2007. A fuzzy extension of the Rand index and other related indexes for clustering and classiﬁcation assessment. Pattern Recognition Lett., 28, 833–841]. However, the proposed fuzzy set-theoretic formulation is not valid as a general approach for comparing two fuzzy partitions of data. Instead, it is an approach for comparing a fuzzy partition against a hard referential partition of the data into mutually disjoint categories. In this paper, generalized external indexes for comparing two data partitions with overlapping categories are introduced. These indexes can be used as general measures for comparing two partitions of the same data set into overlapping categories. An important issue that is seldom touched in the literature is also addressed in the paper, namely, how to compare two partitions of different subsamples of data. A number of pedagogical examples and three simulation experiments are presented and analyzed in details. A review of recent related work compiled from the literature is also provided.},

	abstract = {Previously, eight popular information-theoretic based cluster validity indices have been generalized and tested for probabilistic partitions built by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model. But the analysis was limited to probabilistic clusters and there were limited explanations for differences in the performance of the indices. In this paper, we extend the tests to partitions found by fuzzy c-Means (FCM) and provide further explanations and insights about the performance of these indices. Of the eight generalized indices, we advocate a normalized version of the soft mutual information cluster validity index (NMIsM) as the best overall choice, as it outperforms the other seven indices for both FCM and EM according to our tests on synthetic and real data. The superiority of NMIsM is most pronounced for datasets with overlapped and/or varying sized clusters. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis which helps explain the superior performance of NMIsM compared to the other three normalizations of soft mutual information.},
